Bootstruct is the marriage of the [Construct Template Development Framework](http://construct-framework.com/) and Boostrap for Joomla! 3.x. Utilizing Joomla 3.x's core [JUI](http://kyleledbetter.com/jui/) library as the base CSS, Bootstruct adds Construct's unique logic and features, plus a hybrid responsive grid based on Construct's core grid.
